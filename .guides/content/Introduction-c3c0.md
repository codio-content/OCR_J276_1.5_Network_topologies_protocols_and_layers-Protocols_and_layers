In this lesson we will look at how data is sent and received across the Internet.

In lesson 1 we looked at how data is delivered to the correct recipients on a LAN using the unique MAC address of each connected device. This MAC address is added to the data packets by the Ethernet protocols.
In the previous section (1.4) we saw that to communicate over the internet a device requires an IP address. When the internet messages are finally delivered to the devices in the LAN these MAC addresses are again added by Ethernet protocols.
