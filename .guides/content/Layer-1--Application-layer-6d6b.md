This layer interfaces directly with the applications creating and receiving the data such as web browsers and email clients.
It ensures that the data is produced in a suitable format e.g. that a request for a web stage can be understood by the web server supplying it.

## Protocols of the Application layer

- **HTTP** - Hypertext Transfer Protocol: the rules to be followed by a web server
and a web browser.
- **HTTPS** - Secure HTTP. It ensures that communications between a host and client are secure.
- **FTP** - File Transfer Protocol for the transfer of files between computers.
- **SMTP** - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol: the protocol for sending email messages from client to server and then from server to server until it reaches its destination.
- **POP** - Post Office Protocol: used by a client to retrieve emails from a mail server. All of the emails are downloaded. 
- **IMAP** - Internet Message Access Protocol: the messages are not downloaded. They can be read and stored on the message server.
