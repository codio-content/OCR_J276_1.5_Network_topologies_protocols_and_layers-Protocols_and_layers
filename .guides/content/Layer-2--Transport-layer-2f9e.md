This layer is concerned with computer-to-computer-communication and establishing a connection between them. The devices agree on communication protocols, the size of packet, the speed data can be sent and received.

## Protocols of the Transport layer

- **TCP** â€“  Transmission Control Protocol: it divides the data into packets of the correct size. It also checks the packets as they arrive. If they do not arrive safely or there are any data errors then it asks for them to be re-transmitted. If data is received correctly then it sends an acknowledgement.
