Separating the protocols into functional layers is an example of ‘divide and conquer’. Layering reduces the complexity of the problem because the problem is broken down into smaller parts each of which is easier to solve.

## Advantages of layering:

- It simplifies the overall model by dividing it into functional parts.
- The different layers can be combined in different ways as required.
- One layer can be developed or changed without affecting the other layers.
- It makes it easier to identify and correct networking errors and problems.
- It provides a universal standard for hardware and software manufacturers to follow so that they will be able to communicate with each other.
